# Stateful Widgets

This project allows you to pracitce working with the basics of VueJS. Here we exercise the use of Components, component state,
computed classes / properties, setting up data properties, managing data component state and a few other things.

This project will require you to flesh out a handful of widgets.

## Introduction
The project includes a `src/components` directory that contains several Vue components. With the current setup, all these components
are stateless and hold hard coded values only. It's your job to build out the components. You will be
setting up data properties, writting handlers, computed properties so that a user can interact with the application.

Each component file holds a series of steps that are required to make the widgets work correctly.
